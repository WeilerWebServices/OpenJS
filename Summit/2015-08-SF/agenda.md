  * Create a prioritized list of current and future automation and assign/plan each high value item.

* **Session 3 (Broadening the Collaborator Base)** *4pm - 6pm Thursday*
  * A holistic session to address increasing the number of contributors and broadening the demographics of those participants.
  * Set target goals for end-of-year participation metrics.
  * Develop guidelines for diversity, accessibility and international participation. These guidelines should be specific, as in "do this" "do not do this" rather than subjective. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance to future contribution policies and outreach programs.
   * Map the current new contributors experience.
   * Create a prioritized list of changes to existing processes.
   * Create an outreach plan for achieving participation goals.

* **Session 4 (What is Node.js?)** *10am - 12pm Friday*
  * A discussion of what "the node platform" is.
    * Produce a map of platform areas and APIs packages and applications depend on.
  * A discussion of what the "Node API" should be.
    * Separate the API in to platform areas.
    * Create parallel roadmaps for each to arrive at an API definition.

* **Session 5.1 (The v8 problem)** *1pm - 2pm Friday*
  * Create a list of all the ways in which we are tied to v8 noting which change/break between releases and how.
  * Create a list of issues we encounter when updating v8 and prioritize by severity.
  * Propose solutions to each issue and prioritize.

* **Session 5.2 (Node Fails)** *2pm - 3pm Friday*
  * What happens when failures happen in node?
  * Categorize and Map the variety of failures to their current and possible solutions (promise catches, asyncwrap, tracing, post mortem)
  * Draft parallel roadmaps for each solution.

* **Session 6 (Future)** *4pm - 6pm Friday*
