# Session 1

## Intros and Best Practices

## Who’s Who

Not listed, got too complicated ;)

## Working Groups
 * TSC
 * Build
 * Hardware
 * Diversity
 * Post Mortem
 * Benchmarking
 * Tracing
 * Documentation
 * Evangelism
 * Native Addons
 * INTL
 * LTS
 * Docker
 * API
 * Smoke Test
 * Websites
 * Locales ­ iojs­<language name>, etc. (30+)
 * Streams
 * Facilitating

## Best Practices
 * Having an active contributor(s) who keeps things moving, reviewed, organized, etc. in each group
 * Big injection of new blood post iojs / merger
 * Good initial setup on a repo goes a long way
 * Nice to see global efforts, internationalization
 * The fact WGs even exist!
 * Cross­project tickets to track things between groups
 * using a shared notepad + phone meeting for API review [Non­node WG]
 * Initial in­person / video meetups to build early momentum
 * Onboarding process for core collab.
 * Build ­ lots of communication
 * Finally having discussions == good times, clarity
 * LTS groups good for end users, shows focus on support/stability
 * Automated agenda creation +++ (based on Github labels)
 * Structured meetings
  * Nan has managed to run well without “meeting”
  * Docker

### On the Whiteboard
 * Invite outside participation to existing meeting schedules
 * Chat ­ Gitter, IRC, etc.
 * Driver
 * Regular meeting schedules
 * Automation
 * What can we use for meeting calls?
  * Doodles can be missed, low participation, put out last minute
  * Who’s actually coming, will the meeting actually happen, etc.
  * Tools needed for picking time, emails, RSVP, reminders
  * minutes (tools for collab. markup)
  * agenda
  * publishing
  * bot in IRC for people taking notes / back channel communication (scribe mentions official stuff being discussed)
  * Google ­ increase the call size?
  * AT&T ­ voice
  * Vidyo ­ voice/video
  * ??? there were more

### Not so Good Practices
 * WG boundaries can be unclear
 * Too many volunteers early on, weren’t necessarily ready for them
 * Many groups haven’t had their first true meeting
 * Difficult to find momentum around newer WGs
 * Single point of failure ­ “me” (main volunteer gets busy, things can slow down)
 * Could meetings be automated?
  * Scheduling meetings for everyone can be difficult
  * Hangouts, etc. can have technical problems getting audio/video going {?}
  * No meetings really restricts progress
 * issues marked “unscheduled” [non­Node WG]
 * Groups have lots of ideas on how to move forward ... but still need that next step to really get momentum (for now, monkey patching changes)
 * Hand­off docs to website WG went poorly
 * Communication blockers across WGs
 * Diversity has slow progress
 * Onboarding efforts need to be expanded
  * Where do people get started?
  * Do meetings help put faces to the efforts and actually help make it seem more accessible
 * Concern about API stability / end user comfort vs. great influx of new collaborators.
 * No agenda meetings === bad times
 * Groups that don’t engage/confusion where stuff should go (libuv ­ hardware ­ core)
 * Overlap ownership ­ Node on ARM (hardware, build)
 * Libuv is a dumping ground but no “ownership” by Node (cross­WG volunteers wouldn’t be as inclined to jump in that project to prop it up if low collab. period)

## Goals (aggregate)
 * Meet people
 * move things forward
 * improve interaction between [and within] WGs
 * Educate / improve facilitation...

## Goals in the later sessions

* Come up with as many ideas for goals as possible, big or small, get them all
  * make it safe for more fringe ideas to come out
  * try to articulate ahead of time to keep this process fast
* Clarifying what the goals shared intended (different meanings to different people)
  * “groan zone”
  * The words on the walls will only mean the same to the people in the room, others reading the notes will not have that context
* Prioritization
  * Erasing (not a “veto”, but not time for everything. May come up again later.)
  * Where do the goals converge
  * Documentation can be produced after
   * Reach out to people for clarity (after) when needed to fill in some details

## WG Interaction
 * graph of node­wg­interaction.dot (if useful, comment there & i’ll fix the graph?)
 * External linkage ­ libuv, v8, ...?

## Questions/Future
 * Libuv
 * Working group of working groups
 * Switchboard WG (help WG know how to connect), Collaboration WG
  * best practices
  * tooling
  * switchboard, connecting
