There will be a closing Plenary session from 3:00p-5:00p on 2017-10-07 for
Working Groups and Teams to present on status, progress or whatever they
accomplished during the summit Working Sessions. Every group/team that meets
during the Working Sessions should plan on presenting *something* during this
time, as it is a fantastic opportunity to let the rest of the project know what
is being worked on.
